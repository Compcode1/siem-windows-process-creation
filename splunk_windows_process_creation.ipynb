    "**üîç Splunk Windows Security Log Analysis Project**\n",
    "\n",
    "üéØ Project Goal\n",
    "To investigate Windows Security Event Logs using Splunk in order to detect indicators of compromise (IOCs) and develop a simple threat detection framework that could be used in a real SOC environment. The project will simulate how a security analyst would triage endpoint activity using Windows logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a three-phase project:\n",
    "\n",
    "Establish the normal baseline of Windows activity\n",
    "\n",
    "Identify suspicious or abnormal behaviors\n",
    "\n",
    "Build basic detection logic or alerting rules\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Phase 1 ‚Äì Baseline System Activity**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:**  \n",
    "Establish what \"normal\" activity looks like on the system by analyzing logon behavior captured in native Windows Security logs. This baseline is critical because it defines the standard operating environment: who typically accesses the system, what types of logons occur, when those logons happen, and how the system behaves under normal conditions. Without this understanding, it‚Äôs impossible to reliably detect anomalies or intrusions in later phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this phase, we perform three focused analyses. First, we identify which accounts are logging in, what type of logon they‚Äôre using (such as interactive, remote, or service-based), and from which host. This tells us who is active on the machine and whether that access is consistent with expectations. Next, we analyze how logon types vary over time, allowing us to recognize patterns and detect unusual spikes in behavior that might suggest suspicious activity. Finally, we take a broader look across all Windows Security event codes to understand what kinds of activity the system is generating most frequently. This event inventory gives us a foundation for recognizing rare, unexpected, or high-risk behaviors as we move into threat detection in later phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running any specific queries, it's important to understand what kind of language Splunk uses to retrieve and analyze data. Splunk relies on its own query language called **SPL**, which stands for **Search Processing Language**. SPL is designed to filter, transform, and visualize event data stored in Splunk indexes. It allows analysts to search through massive amounts of machine data quickly and flexibly. The basic structure of an SPL query includes: (1) a search filter, such as a specific index, sourcetype, or event code; (2) a pipeline of commands using pipes (`|`) to transform or group the results; and (3) optional commands to format or visualize the data (e.g., `table`, `stats`, `timechart`). While SPL can become complex, most practical queries are composed of readable, modular steps. In this project, AI-generated SPL will be used to drive analysis, but understanding its structure gives better insight into how filters and logic extract exactly the data we need.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first SPL query we use in this project is designed to show **who is logging in**, **what type of logon they're using**, and **from which machine**. Here's how it works, broken down by each component:\n",
    "\n",
    "index=main sourcetype=WinEventLog:Security EventCode=4624\n",
    "| stats count by Account_Name, Logon_Type, Workstation_Name\n",
    "\n",
    "index=main\n",
    "This tells Splunk to search the \"main\" index, which is the location where incoming log data is stored. An index in Splunk is like a database or storage bucket for a category of logs. You can have multiple indexes (e.g., \"main\", \"firewall\", \"windows\", etc.), but in this project, everything is in \"main\".\n",
    "\n",
    "sourcetype=WinEventLog:Security\n",
    "This narrows the search to only events from the Windows Security Log. The sourcetype is how Splunk labels the kind of data a log comes from ‚Äî in this case, it‚Äôs structured Windows event data, not generic logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "EventCode=4624\n",
    "This filters for successful logon events. Every Windows Security Event has a numeric code that represents a specific action. EventCode 4624 is generated whenever someone (or something) successfully logs into the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "| stats count by Account_Name, Logon_Type, Workstation_Name\n",
    "This part of the query uses a \"stats\" command to group the results. It counts how many times each combination of:\n",
    "\n",
    "Account_Name (the username or system account)\n",
    "\n",
    "Logon_Type (how they logged in ‚Äî e.g., 2 = interactive, 5 = service)\n",
    "\n",
    "Workstation_Name (which machine the logon came from)\n",
    "appeared in the logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, this SPL query builds a simple but powerful picture of normal access patterns: who logs in, how, and where from. It lays the groundwork for detecting abnormal users, unexpected logon types (like remote or batch), or logons from machines that aren‚Äôt part of normal workflows.\n",

    "**Understanding What This Data Represents**\n",
    "\n",
    "The data shown in Query 1 may look overly complex at first, but it reflects common and expected behavior on virtually all Windows systems. Even when a human user is not actively logging in, the operating system itself is constantly performing background logon operations to start services, maintain internal processes, and authenticate accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most frequent entries in our results include:\n",
    "- `DESKTOP-UPKRV33$` with Logon Types 2 and 5\n",
    "- `SYSTEM` with Logon Type 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Let‚Äôs break this down.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What does the dollar sign ($) mean?**  \n",
    "The dollar sign at the end of `DESKTOP-UPKRV33$` indicates that this is a **machine account**, not a human user. In Windows, every computer on a network has its own account in the system's security structure. These accounts are used internally when the system authenticates itself to services ‚Äî for example, when the machine checks in with the domain, starts Windows Update, or initiates a network connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why are there logons from this account with Logon Type 2 or 5?**  \n",
    "- `Logon Type 5` indicates a **service logon**. This happens constantly as Windows services start and stop (e.g., security, networking, system maintenance).\n",
    "- `Logon Type 2` indicates an **interactive logon** ‚Äî typically a human logging in at the keyboard. But when you log in as a user, your machine may also establish an interactive logon under its own system context (`DESKTOP-UPKRV33$`) to perform setup tasks in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is the `SYSTEM` account?**  \n",
    "This is the core **Windows internal operating account**. It runs system-level processes like the kernel, service controllers, and hardware interface tasks. When we see `SYSTEM` logging in with Logon Type 5, it means Windows is activating services or performing internal functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why does this matter to a SIEM like Splunk?**  \n",
    "These logon events represent the **normal baseline** of a Windows machine's background activity. A SIEM like Splunk doesn‚Äôt just record what humans do ‚Äî it records everything the system does. So even when the system is idle, these events are generated continuously.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why our first query is so important: it gives us a clear picture of what \"normal noise\" looks like. Without understanding this, we couldn‚Äôt possibly know when something abnormal (like a remote logon or unexpected user activity) occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, these log entries aren't suspicious ‚Äî they're expected. They reflect the machine authenticating itself, starting services, and operating normally. Every Windows system would show similar patterns unless it was heavily customized or restricted.\n",

Query 2 adds a temporal layer to that picture, showing that these logons occur in predictable hourly patterns, with service logons occurring regularly and interactive logons confined to specific user activity periods. This supports our baseline by confirming that not only are the right accounts logging in, but they are doing so at expected times and in expected volumes. Together, the two queries provide both a static and dynamic view of normal system behavior.\n",

    "While Queries 1 and 2 focused specifically on logon behavior, Query 3 broadens our perspective by showing what kinds of security events the system is generating most frequently overall. This is important because it helps us understand the volume and types of data the system naturally produces, placing our earlier findings into a wider context. For example, we can now see that process creation events (EventCode 4688) dominate the dataset, which is normal for an active Windows machine and reinforces that much of the background noise in Query 2‚Äôs time-based logon activity likely comes from service-level operations. Additionally, seeing EventCode 4624 appear here with a modest count gives us confidence that our logon analysis is well-targeted and representative. Query 3 doesn‚Äôt just inventory events ‚Äî it confirms that what we‚Äôve been looking at so far (logons) is meaningful and proportionally accurate compared to the full scope of system activity. This completes our Phase 1 baseline with a solid understanding of both targeted logon behavior and the broader event landscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Operational Perspective: How Baseline Analysis is Used in Real SOC Environments**\n",
    "\n",
    "Establishing a baseline of system activity ‚Äî like we did in Phase 1 ‚Äî is a fundamental part of security operations in any modern SOC, but it's not typically done manually on a daily basis. Instead, baselining is often performed during initial system deployment, during major configuration changes, or as part of a tuning process when new monitoring rules are created. Most enterprise-grade SIEMs use a combination of historical data, machine learning models, and threshold-based logic to build and maintain dynamic baselines automatically. These baselines track what \"normal\" looks like for users, hosts, logon types, and time-of-day patterns. If activity significantly deviates from those learned norms (for example, an account logging in remotely at 3 AM for the first time), it can generate an alert. So while a human analyst doesn‚Äôt manually re-establish a baseline every day, understanding what the baseline should look like is essential ‚Äî both for building detection logic and for investigating whether an alert is truly anomalous or just part of regular operations. The kind of hands-on baseline analysis we performed here is exactly what junior SOC analysts are expected to understand and interpret when triaging alerts or reviewing user behavior.\n",

Detection A tested for excessive failed logon attempts from a single IP address ‚Äî a common indicator of brute-force activity. The rule returned no matches, confirming that no source generated a suspicious volume of failed logons. Detection B searched for privilege group membership changes outside of business hours ‚Äî a potential sign of unauthorized escalation. This rule also returned no matches, consistent with earlier findings that no group changes had taken place. Together, these rules demonstrate how targeted, rule-based logic can be layered on top of baseline and investigative findings to create real-time alerting mechanisms. Although no threats were found in this environment, the structure of these detections mirrors common industry practice and serves as a foundation for more complex behavioral or anomaly-based logic in future work.\n",

    "The analysis is structured into three progressive phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Phase 1 ‚Äì Baseline System Activity**\n",
    "\n",
    "This phase establishes what \"normal\" looks like on the system by analyzing who logs in, when, from where, and using what type of logon. It provides a behavioral baseline to support later anomaly detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Phase 2 ‚Äì Suspicious Behavior Investigation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using targeted SPL filters, this phase investigates failed logons, account creation, privilege escalation, and off-hours logon activity. These checks are designed to uncover indicators of compromise (IOCs) or policy violations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Phase 3 ‚Äì Detection Logic Prototypes**\n",
    "\n",
    "This final phase converts suspicious patterns into detection rules. It includes simple logic to detect brute-force attempts and privilege changes outside business hours ‚Äî both of which returned no alerts, consistent with the clean baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outcome**\n",
    "\n",
    "No signs of malicious activity were detected during this analysis. However, the methods used reflect standard practices in modern SOC environments and demonstrate how to move from raw data to operational detection logic using Splunk.\n",
